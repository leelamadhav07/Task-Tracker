Developed a full-stack Todo application with a Java backend that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. Supports creating, editing, completing, and deleting tasks with real-time UI updates. All actions are persisted in the database through RESTful APIs, ensuring synchronization between frontend and backend.

Tech: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database, Maven, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Future Enhancements:
  Add task scheduling so users can set reminders or due dates for tasks.
  Implement real-time notifications via email or SMS when tasks are due or completed.
  Deploy the application to cloud platforms (e.g., Google Cloud Run, AWS, or Heroku) for 24/7 availability.
  Separate completed and pending tasks in different sections for better UX.
  Integrate persistent database storage (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for production readiness.
